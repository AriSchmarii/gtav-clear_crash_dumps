# gtav-clear_crash_dumps
is a small executable file to delete all crash logs left by gtav on your computer
# What is the purpose?
When an instance of GTA-V crashes, a .dmp file is automatically created and uploaded to the crash log service they use (backtrace.io).
All of these files stay on your computer and take up a few hundred MB or even GB on your hard drive over time.
